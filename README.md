# ILO-Selenium-Automation-Scripts
Scripts that i use to automate startup and shutdown of my servers using selenium.

The ******* lines have been placed instead of passwords/logins and the ip address for obvious reasons. In the case of the vault.py and the gser.py the UN is 
login and the PW is password.

The vault.py script works on the HP SE326M1 (ILO2)
The gser.py script works on the HP DL380G6 (ILO2)
The g585.py script works on the HP DL585G7 (ILO3)

There are some differences between vault.py and gser.py since they use slightly different versions of ILO2 but with some slight adjustments the scripts can be 
adapted to any version (probably).Also i used firefox instead of chrome as i knew what to set in the profile so that it can access these outdated websites but if
you are more familiar with chrome thean propably you can do the same.
